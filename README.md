# gitlab-ci-android-fastlane with node
This Docker image contains the Android SDK and most common packages necessary for building Android apps in a CI tool like GitLab CI (Android SDK, git, fastlane). Make sure your CI environment's caching works as expected, this greatly improves the build time, especially if you use multiple build jobs.

This Docker image adds Node to your building process.
